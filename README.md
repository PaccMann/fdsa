# Fully Differentiable Set Autoencoder (fdsa)

A fully differentiable set autoencoder for encoding sets. [Paper @KDD 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3534678.3539153).


The work is inspired by ["The Set Autoencoder: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Sets "](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tJKuyRZ). The model makes use of an
encoder from ["Order Matters: Sequence to sequence for sets"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06391) and the decoder is a slightly modified version of the one in ["The Set Autoencoder: Unsupervised Representation Learning for Sets "](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1tJKuyRZ). To efficiently match the reconstructions of the autoencoder to their corresponding inputs to create a differentiable loss function, three architectures were developed and evaluated that could approximate the assignment problem and thus act as an end-to-end
set matching network. The package includes code for these networks as well as baseline implementations of the set autoencoder fitted with the Hungarian matching algorithm and the Gale-Shapley algorithm.
